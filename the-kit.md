The Speaking in Code Kit is #codespeak in a box. Its purpose is to amplify the
voices, continue the conversations, and enable more DH and digital library
software developers to join in on the discussions started in the original
Speaking in Code.

There are no step-by-step instructions. Each Speaking in Code summit should be
different, addressing the needs of the participants. Instead, the Kit is a
loose set of suggestions, priorities, and practices to encourage the type of
discussion that the Scholars' Lab attendees found transformative. 

The only concrete tool in the Kit is a website template. It includes basic
styling, slots for necessary information, and slots for interested
practitioners. To use this, you can fork the git repository and customize the
template as you see fit.
