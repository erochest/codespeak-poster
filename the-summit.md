Speaking in Code was a summit held in November 2013 by the Scholars' Lab with
funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities. For two days,
approximately thirty software developers and practitioners gathered to dissect
the tacit knowledge embedded in and informing the practice of software
development in DH projects.

The first day of the summit featured presentations by four experienced
developers.

* William J. Turkel (Western University) on Tacit Knowledge in Code
* Stéfan Sinclair (McGill University) on Procedural Interface Design
* Hugh Cayless (Duke University) on Designing Text Models for Language
* Mia Ridge (Open University) on Messy Understandings

The presentations and subsequent discussions laid the groundwork for the next
day. This contained a number of un-conference-style break-out groups where
participants could interact and meet around common points of interest.

Under the leadership of the participants, the discussion soon diverged from
talking about tacit knowledge and code critique. Instead, they spent the time
discussing ways to dismantle social barriers, both explicit and implicit,
spoken and tacit — barriers to access to digital humanities communities and
conversations and internal barriers dividing the DH community.
